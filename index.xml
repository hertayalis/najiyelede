&amp;nbsp;You‚Äôll need at least a 6 X 12 trailer to carry two ATVs nose to tail, or a 6 X 10 foot trailer if you can load side by side. Most ATVs can be hauled in a 6 X 10 trailer if one is loaded sideways and the other upright.
&amp;nbsp;
In turn, how much of a trailer do I need for a UTV? The simple answer is that you can accommodate many single UTVs on a 5 X 12 foot trailer, while many UTVs will need a 14 foot or 16 foot trailer.</description></item><item><title>Cub Cadet 982 Price, Specs, Review, Attachments 2022</title><link>/cub-cadet-982.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/cub-cadet-982.html</guid><description>Cub Cadet 982 Price, Reviews, Specs, Engine Oil Capacity, Weight, Serial Numbers,&amp;nbsp; Attachments, History, Features &amp;amp; Pictures Cub Cadet 982 Garden Tractor is equipped with an Onan B48G gasoline 2-cylinder air-cooled, 781 cc engine, which delivers 19.9 hp (14.8 kW) power at rated rpm 3200.
