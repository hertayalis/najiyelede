cumbersome and Europe is reluctant to extradite to China.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She added: 'I do not see what is wrong in pressuring criminals to face justice with all the guarantees contained in Chinese law', adding that 'only legal means are used.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>All this has led to growing fears that there will be more tales like that of Liu, a Chinese resident in Spain.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Liu was wanted by prosecutors in China for ‘environmental pollution’ before being apprehended by a ‘spy station’ in Madrid in 2020.</p><img
